# Thot Patrol
An open source (preferably) NoCheatPlus add-on that was made with intentions to (poorly) patch things that the NCP developers flat out ignore or just never get to because of real-life matters. Will hopefully become a fully fledged AntiCheat that can be used independently from other ones.
